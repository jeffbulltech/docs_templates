## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of [PROJECT_NAME] seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Private Vulnerability Reporting

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](../../security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form with as much detail as possible

This will create a private security advisory that only the maintainers can see, allowing us to assess and address the issue before it becomes public.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following information:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration required** to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security vulnerability reports within the following timeframes:

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Status update**: Within 7 days with either a resolution or an update on progress
- **Resolution**: We will work to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance
4. Release new versions as soon as possible
5. Prominently feature the problem in the release notes

### Security Best Practices

To help ensure the security of [PROJECT_NAME], we recommend:

- **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update all dependencies to their latest secure versions
- **Use supported versions**: Only use versions of [PROJECT_NAME] that are currently supported with security updates
- **Follow secure coding practices**: When contributing code, follow established security guidelines
- **Report suspicious activity**: If you notice any suspicious activity or potential security issues, report them immediately

### Security Measures

This project implements the following security measures:

- [ ] **Dependency scanning**: Automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] **Code analysis**: Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Access controls**: Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- [ ] **Input validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- [ ] **Secure defaults**: Security-first default configurations
- [ ] **Regular audits**: Periodic security audits and assessments

### Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns that are not vulnerabilities, you can contact the security team at:

- **Email**: [SECURITY_EMAIL]
- **PGP Key**: [PGP_KEY_ID] (if applicable)
